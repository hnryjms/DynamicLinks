Dynamic Sitelinks converts your internal Site URL links into ones that change with the Site URL, so you can move your blog to new domains.

== Description ==

Dynamic Sitelinks will convert all existing Site URL links in your posts and pages into a format that will change with the Site Address (URL) field in Settings > General. When you need to move your blog, all you'll have to do is change the Site Address option in Wordpress and all your links will automatically be updated.

Note: Dynamic Links will not find your links if you activate the plugin after you have already changed your Site Address since you added the links with Wordpress's editor.

== Installation ==

The plugin is simple to install:

1. Download the Dynamic Sitelinks plugin file (`.zip`)
1. Unzip and upload the folder to your `wp-content/plugins` folder
1. Go to the Plugins page and activate the Dynamic Siteinks plugin

Dynamic Links will update all your existing and new posts that contain your **current** Site Address into the new format. When you then change the Site URL, all your posts will automatically be adjusted.

Note: Dynamic Links will not find your links if you activate the plugin after you have already changed your Site Address since you added the links with Wordpress's editor.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My posts don't look any different. Is it working? =

Dynamic Sitelinks replaces your Site Address with the shortcode `[site_domain]`. It also changes that shortcode into your current domain when you're editing posts so images and other resources still appear properly in the Visual editor. They'll be converted back when you save.
